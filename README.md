## Projects description 
### Wine project  
Structure of project:  
```` 
wine project
     ├── winequality-red.csv                        - contains data  
     ├── Wine_Quality.ipynb                         - code for data analysis and machine learning
```` 
winequality-red.csv contains data about wine (fixed acidity, volatile acidity, citric acid, residual sugar, chlorides, free sulfur dioxide, total sulfur dioxide, density, pH, sulphates, alcohol, quality) where quality is predicted value. The goal was to study the SMOTE method and compare the results.  
 
### Mashroom project

mashroom project
     ├── mashrooms.csv                               - contains data  
     ├── mashrooms.ipynb                             - code for data analysis and machine learning 
```` 
winequality-red.csv contains data about mashrooms (cap-shape, cap-surface, cap-color, bruises, odor, gill-attachment, gill-spacing, gill-size, gill-color, stalk-shape, stalk-root, stalk-surface-above-ring, stalk-surface-below-ring, stalk-color-above-ring, stalk-color-below-ring, veil-type, veil-color, ring-number, ring-type, spore-print-color, population, habitat) where class is predicted value (e - edible, p - poison). The goal was to analyze database and compare the results of algorithms.  
### Fish project  
Structure of project:  
```` 
Fish project
     ├── fish.ipynb                                  - code for machine learning 
```` 
The goal was to build CNN for predicting fish and compare the results.
